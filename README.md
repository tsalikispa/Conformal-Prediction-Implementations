# Conformal Prediction Implementations

This repository provides **academic implementations and demonstrations of Conformal Prediction (CP)** — a powerful statistical framework for constructing reliable prediction sets with guaranteed coverage.  
It includes both **NumPy-based** and **TorchCP-based** examples, intended for researchers, students, and practitioners working on **uncertainty quantification** and **distribution-free predictive inference**.

## 🧭 Overview

Conformal Prediction offers **distribution-free uncertainty quantification** by producing *prediction sets* that contain the true label with a user-specified confidence level.  
Unlike traditional probabilistic models, CP provides **finite-sample coverage guarantees** under the assumption of data exchangeability.

This repository contains two main implementations:
