# Conformal Prediction Implementations

This repository provides concise implementations of **Conformal Prediction (CP)** using both **NumPy** and **TorchCP**, illustrating how to construct reliable, distribution-free prediction sets for prediction tasks.

---

## 🧭 Overview

- **NumPy implementation:** transparent, from-scratch version for educational use.  
- **TorchCP implementation:** deep learning–based examples using PyTorch and the [TorchCP](https://github.com/valeman/TorchCP) library.  

The goal is to demonstrate **uncertainty quantification**, **coverage calibration**, and **prediction set construction** for machine learning models.
